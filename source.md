# Source Material
Here's some of the materials I used for the following exercise.
- The [Gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/98/98-h/98-h.htm) HTML file of *A Tale of Two Cities* by Charles Dickens.
- The Steam game [*1775: Rebellion](https://store.steampowered.com/app/422610/1775_Rebellion/) whose cover images I borrow for the purposes of this file. 
- This [\*really\* helpful guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to formatting Markdown on GitHub
